# Online-Sales-Data-Analysis
In this  project I have taken sales transaction data XLS file  from UCI website and assess the performance of the company in which I analyse the data with relevant  visualizations and metrics on Power BI which contains all the transactions, purchases, quantity and price of different products which are bought by different customers from 1st December, 2010 to 9th December, 2011.
